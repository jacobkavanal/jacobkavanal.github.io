				<p id="about">
					SJ Works creates meaningful youth employment opportunities to help at-risk and underserved youth build towards college and careers. A job for any young person can be the first step in the pathway to long-term success. By investing in pathways to employment for at-risk youth between the ages of 14-29, particularly those in gang-impacted neighborhoods, the city intends to broaden opportunities for many teens who struggle against the Valley’s widening economic gap, and make San José safer.<br><br>Teen training and job placement programs have the power to reach disconnected youth and create pathways to positive outcomes. Investing in job-readiness and employment experiences can lead to the additional schooling and skill-building needed for career-track employment. Simultaneously, many employers indicate a desire to hire locally and train youth, but don't have the staff to guide young adults in financial literacy and other life skills. Working in partnership with employers, schools, and community-based organizations, SJ Works piloted new strategies to develop a scalable and sustainable system to deliver youth employment opportunities.
